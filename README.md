# LabVIEW Projects

This repostory was created to host the LabVIEW projects for demonstration. Each folder in the folder structure contains a different LabVIEW project. Summary of these projects is described below as well and the links provided can be followed to obtain more information about the projects.

## ETA for Next Tram

This project implements the functionality to perform HTTP GET requests to obtain data from the server and use Python for some basic string processing. The ability to run Python code from LabVIEW opens a lot of possibilities for data processing as there are a number of very capable data processing libraries available for Python such as OpenCV. Python is also the main language, these days, for Machine and Deep Learning projects.

## Counter with Event Handler

This project implemenents the user interface and custom logic for a counter program that can be incremented and decremented using buttons. The buttons trigger Event Callback handlers and perform the required operations. The project also saves the data recorded to a TDMS file. The following GIF shows the basic working of the project.

## Temperature Converter

This project implements the user interface and the formula for converting temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. It also takes into account good design principles of user interface design. The following GIF shows the basic working of the project.
